# DECISIONS.md

Lightweight ADR log for DwellVerdict. Every decision that deviates from
`CLAUDE.md` or the technical spec lands here. The first five ADRs — the
foundational stack choices — are initialized in M6 as part of the Phase 0
wrap-up. Interim entries (like outstanding TODOs) live under **Pending**
until they're resolved or promoted to a full ADR.

## Pending

### TODO — dedicated Neon test branch before M5 CI

**Owner:** whoever wires M5 CI.
**Status:** deferred from M3b.
**Context:** M3b's three integration tests hit the same Neon dev branch as
local development, isolated by `clerk_id` prefixes (`test_<uuid>_`) with
`afterEach` cleanup. Acceptable for three tests run manually or in series.

Once M5 wires the test job into GitHub Actions on every PR, parallel runs
(e.g. a push while a PR check is running) will race on the same branch.
Prefix cleanup prevents data collisions but does not prevent dev branch
pollution if a test process is killed mid-run.

**Action:** before the M5 CI workflow is merged:
1. Create a dedicated Neon branch `test` off `main`.
2. Add `TEST_DATABASE_URL` to Vercel + GitHub Actions secrets.
3. Update `apps/web/tests/setup.ts` to prefer `TEST_DATABASE_URL` when set.
4. Leave the prefix cleanup in place as a defense-in-depth measure.
